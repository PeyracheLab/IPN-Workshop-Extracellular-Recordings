## Data path and naming convention
CellExplorer uses one main path for each session called `basepath`. The basepath should contains the raw ephys data as well. The data in the basepath should follow this naming convention: `basename.*`, e.g. `basename.dat` and `basename.lfp` (low-pass filtered and down-sampled. The lfp file is automatically generated in the pipeline if necessary). The clustered data can be in a (relative) sub directory, defined in `session.spikeSorting.relativePath` or in the basepath, all files generated by CellExplorer will be saved to the basepath. Each session is identified by a `basename`. It is recommended to follow the naming convention: `/path_to_data/basename/`, meaning that the folder containing the dataset is named `basename`.

## Data structures
Each type of data is saved in its own MATLAB structure, where a subset of the structures are inherited from [buzcode](https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode). Please see the list of data containers in the next section.  CellExplorer is fully compatible with the Buzcode toolbox repository.
