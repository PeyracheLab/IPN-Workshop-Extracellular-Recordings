### CellExplorer

| Elements | Description       | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| About CellExplorer | Shows dialog with basic info about CellExplorer |
| Edit preferences   | Opens [CellExplorer preferences](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/preferences/), which are stored in `preferences_CellExplorer.m` | 
| Run Benchmarks     | Run various benchmarks as showed in Supplementary figure 5 | 
| Quit               | Quit CellExplorer. This will save any manual curation to the output from the call, e.g. `cell_metrics = CellExplorer('metrics',cell_metrics);`. Closing the main window has the same effect. |

### File

| Elements | Description       | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Load session from file             | Opens a file dialog where you can select a cell metrics Matlab file to load | 
| Save classification                | Saves any manual curation to the original cell metrics files. This also works in batch mode, allowing you to save any changes back to the original cell metrics calculated per session. | 
| Restore classification from backup | Shows a dialog with a list of backup steps for the current session. Choose any backup point to restore to that state. Every time the cell metrics are processed again with `ProcessCellMetrics.m` and curation are saved via CellExplorer, a backup is created. Backups are stored in a subfolder with the data | 
| Reload cell metrics                | Reload cell metrics from original files | 
| Export main figure window          | [Exports the CellExplorer interface](https://cellexplorer.org/tutorials/export-figure/) | 
| Generate supplementary figure      | Generates a [supplementary figure](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/capabilities/#export-supplementary-figure) optimized for publication (see figures below with the dialog and supplementary figure). You can select which metrics to show in panels in C and D | 
| Generate summary figure            | Generates a summary figure, which is also generate by the processing module |
