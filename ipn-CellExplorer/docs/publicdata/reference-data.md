# Download and use data in CellExplorer
Any sessions located in the repository **NYUshare_Datasets** is publicly available and can be downloaded and loaded automatically in CellExplorer, without database credentials. Upon request the data will be downloaded from our [public web share](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/) and saved to the local CellExplorer directory `referenceData/` for future access. Be patient when downloading the data as some sessions are very large (spanning a few to hundreds of MB). Once data has been loaded as reference data, you can directly explore the reference data by selecting __Explore reference data__ from the Reference data menu in CellExplorer.
