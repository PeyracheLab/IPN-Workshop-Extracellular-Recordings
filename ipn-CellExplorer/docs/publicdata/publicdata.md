# Data access
{: .no_toc}
We are sharing a variety of data from behaving rats and mice. Combined more than 70.000 cells are available to explore or use as reference data for classifying your own data. The cells are primarily from the Hippocampus and visual cortex but also from many other brain regions. CellExplorer achieves this by communicating with the [Buzsaki lab databank](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/database/). The public data in the databank can be downloaded and loaded as reference data without login credentials. Credentials are necessary for having full access and writing capabilities. We are also sharing [ground truth data](/publicdata/ground-truth-data/), which are hundreds of opto-tagged cell types from several mouse lines.
