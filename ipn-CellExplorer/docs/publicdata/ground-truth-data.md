# Ground truth data
{: .no_toc}
At present (November 2020) the list includes PV, SST, Axo-axonic cells, VGAT and VIP cells and Pyramidal cells, and we will continue to expand with more cells. The goal is to perform the classification from ground truth cell metrics. If you have opto-tagged data that you are interested in sharing/including, please reach out to us. See the [ground truth tutorial]({{"/tutorials/ground-truth-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) to learn more about using the included ground truth data. The table below lists the cell-types, their counts and the contributors:

| Cell-type  | Count | Contributors |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| PV         | 184   | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute; Sam McKenzie & Yuta Senzai, Buzsaki lab |
| SST        | 115   | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute |
| Pyramidal cells | 44 | Roman Huszar, Buzsaki lab |
| Axo-axonic | 35    | Dan English & Sam McKenzie, Buzsaki lab |
| VGAT       | 15    | Yuta Senzai, Buzsaki lab |
| VIP        | 14    | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute |

### Classifying your cells in CellExplorer
You can also implement your own ground truth cells into the pipeline or do the classification in CellExplorer. Once classified you can share your metrics list with collaborators or provide them for publications.

Please see the [opto-tagging tutorial]({{"/tutorials/optotagging-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) for how to do the ground truth classification on your own data.
