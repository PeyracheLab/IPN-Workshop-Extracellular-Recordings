# Processing metrics
{: .no_toc}
The complete pipeline consists of three main steps: 1. Preparing experimental metadata, 2. Processing cell_metrics and 3. Running CellExplorer. All metrics are calculated using a single processing script (the processing module). You can add your own metrics and custom calculations to the pipeline.
