# IPN Summer School on Extracellular recordings


- Understand the origin of extracellular fields and currents 
- Familiarize with different acquisition systems and recording methods, hardware (e.g. electrode types and the impact on the extracellular recordings) 
- Be able to visualize the raw signal and apply pre-processing techniques (e.g. noise, signal processing, filtering)
- Understand the theory of ‘spike sorting’ and use a state-of-the-art package for this purpose (Kilosort)
- Understand and be able to do LFP analysis (Brainstorm)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization, and relationships between spikes and LFPs (e.g. Brainstorm - CellExplorer and scripting)
